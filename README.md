# Spring-boot-Apache-Kafka

Project Overview 

This application replicates a project I previously worked on. In this project, 10,000 random messages are generated, published to a Kafka cluster, consumed by a Kafka consumer, and then stored in a database. It demonstrates end-to-end message processing and storage using Kafka and MS SQL Database.
